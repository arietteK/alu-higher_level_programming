Python - Everything is object            
This project has exercises that help to explore key concepts about Python objects, types, memory management, mutability, and argument passing. Throughout this project, you will gain a deeper understanding of Python's internal workings and its treatment of objects, especially in terms of mutability and immutability.       

Tasks Breakdown    

Who Am I?    
In this task, you will learn how to identify the type of an object in Python.

Where Are You?     
Learn how to get the memory address (identifier) of a variable in Python using the id() function.
File: 1-answer.txt      

Right Count       
Determine if two variables point to the same object by comparing their values and memory addresses.
File: 2-answer.txt     

Right Count =     
A similar task where you compare two variables initialized to the same value to determine if they point to the same object.

Right Count =+    
Compare two variables where one is assigned the result of an operation.

Is the Same       
Learn the difference between == (equality) and is (identity) by comparing objects with the is operator.

And with a List, Is It Equal    
Compare two lists and determine if they are equal based on their content.      
File: 10-answer.txt      

And with a List, Is It the Same      
Compare two lists to see if they point to the same object in memory.       
File: 11-answer.txt      

And with a List, Is It Really Equal     
Compare two lists for equality and identity using both == and is.        
File: 12-answer.txt      

And with a List, Is It Really the Same       
Learn how Python handles list assignments and object identity when one list is assigned to another.         
File: 13-answer.txt       

List Append       
Explore how appending elements to a list affects its identity when assigned to another variable.       
File: 14-answer.txt       

List Add       
Investigate how adding to a list (using the + operator) affects its identity compared to the append method.         
File: 15-answer.txt        

Integer Incrementation         
Learn how Python handles immutable types (like integers) in function arguments and how changes affect their identity.         
File: 16-answer.txt         

List Incrementation        
Learn how Python handles mutable types (like lists) in function arguments and how changes affect their identity.        
File: 17-answer.txt      

List Assignation         
Study how reassigning a list in a function affects the original list.        
File: 18-answer.txt          

Copy a List Object      
Write a function to return a copy of a list without importing any external modules.          
File: 19-copy_list.py          

Tuple or Not? (1)          
Learn how to check if a variable is a tuple by examining different types of objects.        
File: 20-answer.txt        

Tuple or Not? (2)       
Investigate how Python treats single-element tuples.       
File: 21-answer.txt 

Tuple or Not? (3)         
Understand why a single-element tuple requires a trailing comma to be recognized as a tuple.        
File: 22-answer.txt       

Tuple or Not? (4)         
Confirm how Python treats an expression with a single element and how the () operator works for tuples.        
File: 23-answer.txt         

Who I Am? (Tuple Identity)        
Examine identity and equality of tuples with the same values.        
File: 24-answer.txt        

Tuple or Not? (Equality vs Identity)       
Compare two tuples that have identical elements and determine if they point to the same object.         
File: 25-answer.txt      

Empty is Not Empty        
Investigate how Python handles multiple empty tuples in memory.        
File: 26-answer.txt      

Still the Same?      
Explore how the id() of an object changes when performing operations that modify or reassign it.        
File: 27-answer.txt     

Same or Not?
