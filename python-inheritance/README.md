Python - Inheritance     
This project focuses on the concepts of object-oriented programming, specifically inheritance in Python. It consists of a series of tasks that require building classes and functions to demonstrate and validate different inheritance principles.       

Project Tasks    
Below is a brief summary of each task:    

Task 0: Lookup    
File: 0-lookup.py       
Description: Write a function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object.      
Prototype: def lookup(obj):        

Task 1: My List       
File: 1-my_list.py       
Description: Create a class MyList that inherits from list and includes a method print_sorted() to print the list in ascending order.         

Task 2: Exact Same Object         
File: 2-is_same_class.py        
Description: Write a function that checks if an object is exactly an instance of a specified class.            
Prototype: def is_same_class(obj, a_class):           

Task 3: Same Class or Inherit From             
File: 3-is_kind_of_class.py           
Description: Implement a function to check if an object is an instance of a class or a class it inherits from.          
Prototype: def is_kind_of_class(obj, a_class):           
       
Task 4: Only Subclass Of                 
File: 4-inherits_from.py         
Description: Create a function that returns True if an object is an instance of a class that inherited (directly or indirectly) from a specified class.           
Prototype: def inherits_from(obj, a_class):             
     
Task 5: Geometry Module       
File: 5-base_geometry.py            
Description: Create an empty class BaseGeometry.        

Task 6: Improve Geometry           
File: 6-base_geometry.py              
Description: Add a method area() to BaseGeometry that raises an exception with the message "area() is not implemented".        
       
Task 7: Integer Validator             
File: 7-base_geometry.py             
Description: Extend BaseGeometry with a method integer_validator(name, value) that validates if value is an integer and greater than 0.             

Task 8: Rectangle           
File: 8-rectangle.py           
Description: Create a Rectangle class that inherits from BaseGeometry, with validated width and height.             
 
Task 9: Full Rectangle         
File: 9-rectangle.py             
Description: Implement a Rectangle class with the area() method and a custom __str__() method that returns [Rectangle] <width>/<height>.          

Task 10: Square #1              
File: 10-square.py            
Description: Create a Square class that inherits from Rectangle and implements the area() method.          

Task 11: Square #2          
File: 11-square.py           
Description: Extend the Square class to override the __str__() method, printing [Square] <size>/<size>.
